# OpenBCI Node.js SDK

A Node.js module for OpenBCI ~ written with love by [Push The World!](http://www.pushtheworldllc.com)

We are proud to support all functionality of the OpenBCI 8 Channel board (16 channel coming soon) and are actively developing and maintaining this module. 

The purpose of this module is to **get connected** and **start streaming** as fast as possible. 

## TL;DR

#### Install via npm:

```
npm install openbci-sdk
```

#### Get connected and start streaming

```js
var OpenBCIBoard = require('openbci-sdk').OpenBCIBoard;
var ourBoard = new OpenBCIBoard();
ourBoard.connect(portName)
    .then(function() {
        ourBoard.on('ready',function() {
            ourBoard.streamStart();
            ourBoard.on('sample',function(sample) {
                /** Work with sample */
                for (var i = 0; i < ourBoard.numberOfChannels(); i++) {
                    console.log("Channel " + (i + 1) + ": " + sample.channelData[i].toFixed(8) + " Volts."); 
                    // prints to the console
                    //  "Channel 1: 0.00001987 Volts."
                    //  "Channel 2: 0.00002255 Volts."
                    //  ...
                    //  "Channel 8: -0.00001875 Volts."
                }
            });
        });
})
```

Want to know if the module really works? Check out some projects and organizations using it:

* [_OpenEXP_](https://github.com/openexp/OpenEXP): an open-source desktop app for running experiments and collecting behavioral and physiological data.
* [_Thinker_](http://www.pushtheworldllc.com/#!thinker/uc1fn): a project building the world's first brainwave-word database.
* [_NeuroJS_](https://github.com/NeuroJS): a community dedicated to Neuroscience research using JavaScript, they have several great examples.

Still not satisfied it works?? Check out this [detailed report](http://s132342840.onlinehome.us/pushtheworld/files/voltageVerificationTestPlanAndResults.pdf) that scientifically validates the output voltages of this module.

How are you still doubting and not using this already? Fine, go look at some of the [400 **_automatic_** tests](https://codecov.io/github/OpenBCI/openbci-js-sdk?branch=master) written for it!

## General Overview

Initialization
--------------

Initializing the board:

```js
var OpenBCIBoard = require('openbci-sdk');
var ourBoard = new OpenBCIBoard.OpenBCIBoard();
```

For initializing with options, such as verbose print outs:

```js
var OpenBCIBoard = require('openbci-sdk').OpenBCIBoard;
var ourBoard = new OpenBCIBoard({
    verbose: true
});
```

Or if you don't have a board and want to use synthetic data:

```js
var OpenBCIBoard = require('openbci-sdk').OpenBCIBoard;
var ourBoard = new OpenBCIBoard({
    simulate: true
});
```

Another useful way to start the simulator:
```js
var openBCIBoard = require('openbci-sdk');
var k = openBCIBoard.OpenBCIConstants;
var ourBoard = openBCIBoard.OpenBCIBoard();
ourBoard.connect(k.OBCISimulatorPortName) // This will set `simulate` to true
    .then(function(boardSerial) {
        ourBoard.on('ready',function() {
            /** Start streaming, reading registers, what ever your heart desires  */
        });
    }).catch(function(err) {
        /** Handle connection errors */
    });
```


'ready' event
------------

You MUST wait for the 'ready' event to be emitted before streaming/talking with the board. The ready happens asynchronously 
so installing the 'sample' listener and writing before the ready event might result in... nothing at all.

```js
var OpenBCIBoard = require('openbci-sdk').OpenBCIBoard;
var ourBoard = new OpenBCIBoard();
ourBoard.connect(portName).then(function(boardSerial) {
    ourBoard.on('ready',function() {
        /** Start streaming, reading registers, what ever your heart desires  */
    });
}).catch(function(err) {
    /** Handle connection errors */
});            
```

Sample properties:
------------------
* `startByte` (`Number`  should be `0xA0`)
* `sampleNumber` (a `Number` between 0-255) 
* `channelData` (channel data indexed at 0 filled with floating point `Numbers` in Volts)
* `auxData` (aux data indexed starting at 0 [0,1,2] filled with floating point `Numbers`)
* `stopByte` (`Number` should be `0xC0`)

The power of this module is in using the sample emitter, to be provided with samples to do with as you wish.

You can also start the simulator by sending `.connect(portName)` with `portName` equal to `'OpenBCISimulator'`.

To get a 'sample' event, you need to:
-------------------------------------
1. Call `.connect(serialPortName)`
2. Install the 'ready' event emitter on resolved promise
3. In callback for 'ready' emitter, call `streamStart()`
4. Install the 'sample' event emitter
```js
var OpenBCIBoard = require('openbci-sdk').OpenBCIBoard;
var ourBoard = new OpenBCIBoard();
ourBoard.connect(portName).then(function() {
    ourBoard.on('ready',function() {
        ourBoard.streamStart();
        ourBoard.on('sample',function(sample) {
            /** Work with sample */
        });
    });
}).catch(function(err) {
    /** Handle connection errors */
});            
```
Close the connection with `.streamStop()` and disconnect with `.disconnect()`
```js
var ourBoard = new require('openbci-sdk').OpenBCIBoard();
ourBoard.streamStop().then(ourBoard.disconnect());
```

Auto-finding boards
-------------------
You must have the OpenBCI board connected to the PC before trying to automatically find it.

If a port is not automatically found, then call `.listPorts()` to get a list of all serial ports this would be a good place to present a drop down picker list to the user, so they may manually select the serial port name.

```js
var OpenBCIBoard = require('openbci-sdk').OpenBCIBoard;
var ourBoard = new OpenBCIBoard();
ourBoard.autoFindOpenBCIBoard().then(portName => {
    if(portName) {
        /** 
        * Connect to the board with portName
        * i.e. ourBoard.connect(portName).....
        */
    } else {
        /**Unable to auto find OpenBCI board*/
    }
});
```

Note: `.autoFindOpenBCIBoard()` will return the name of the Simulator if you instantiate with option `simulate: true`.

Auto Test - (Using impedance to determine signal quality)
---------------------------------------------------------
Measuring impedance is a vital tool in ensuring great data is collected. 

**_IMPORTANT!_** Measuring impedance takes time, so *only test what you must*

Your OpenBCI board will have electrodes hooked up to either a P input, N input or in some cases both inputs. 

To test specific inputs of channels:

1. Connect to board.
2. Start streaming.
3. Install the 'impedanceArray' emitter
4. Call `.impedanceTestChannels()` with your configuration array

A configuration array looks like, for an 8 channel board, `['-','N','n','p','P','-','b','b']`

Where there are the same number of elements as channels and each element can be either:

* `p` or `P` (only test P input)
* `n` or `N` (only test N input)
* `b` or `B` (test both inputs) (takes 66% longer to run then previous two `p` or `n`)
* `-` (ignore channel)

Without further ado, here is an example:
```js
var OpenBCIBoard = require('openbci-sdk').OpenBCIBoard;
var ourBoard = new OpenBCIBoard();
ourBoard.connect(portName).then(function(boardSerial) {
    ourBoard.on('ready',function() {
        ourBoard.streamStart();
        ourBoard.once('impedanceArray', impedanceArray => {
            /** Work with impedance Array */
        });
        ourBoard.impedanceTestChannels(['n','N','n','p','P','p','b','B']).catch(err => console.log(err));
    });
}).catch(function(err) {
    /** Handle connection errors */
}); 
```

But wait! What is this `impedanceArray`? An Array of Objects, for each object:
```js
[{
    channel: 1,
    P: {
        raw: -1, 
        text: 'init'
    },
    N: {
        raw: -1, 
        text: 'init'
    }
},
{
    // Continues for each channel up to the amount of channels on board (8 or 16)
},...];
```

Where:

* *channel* is the channel number (`impedanceArray[0]` is channel 1, `impedanceArray[6]` is channel 7)
* *P* is the P input data (Note: P is capitalized)
  * *raw* is an impedance value resulting from the Goertzel algorithm.
  * *text* is a text interpretation of the `average`
    * **Good** impedance is < 5k Ohms
    * **Ok** impedance is 5 to 10k Ohms
    * **Bad** impedance is > 10k Ohms
    * **None** impedance is > 1M Ohms
* *N* is the N input data (Note: N is capitalized) (see above for what N object consists of)

To run an impedance test on all inputs, one channel at a time:

1. Connect to board
2. Start streaming
3. Install the 'impedanceObject'
4. Call `.impedanceTestAllChannels()`

**Note: Takes up to 5 seconds to start measuring impedances. There is an unknown number of samples taken. Not always 60!**

For example:

```js
var OpenBCIBoard = require('openbci-sdk').OpenBCIBoard;
var ourBoard = new OpenBCIBoard();
ourBoard.connect(portName).then(function(boardSerial) {
    ourBoard.streamStart();
    ourBoard.on('impedanceArray', impedanceArray => {
        /** Work with impedance */
    });
    ourBoard.impedanceTestAllChannels();
}
```

See Reference Guide for a complete list of impedance tests.

### .autoFindOpenBCIBoard()

Automatically find an OpenBCI board. 

**Note: This will always return an Array of `COM` ports on Windows**

**_Returns_** a promise, fulfilled with a `portName` such as `/dev/tty.*` on Mac/Linux or `OpenBCISimulator` if `this.options.simulate === true`.

### .channelOff(channelNumber)

Turn off a specified channel

Turn on a specified channel

**_channelNumber_**

A number (1-16) specifying which channel you want to turn on. 

**_Returns_** a promise, fulfilled if the command was sent to the write queue.

### .channelSet(channelNumber,powerDown,gain,inputType,bias,srb2,srb1)

Send a channel setting command to the board.

**_channelNumber_**  

Determines which channel to set. It's a 'Number' (1-16)

**_powerDown_** 

Powers the channel up or down. It's a 'Bool' where `true` turns the channel off and `false` turns the channel on (default)

**_gain_**
 
Sets the gain for the channel. It's a 'Number' that is either (1,2,4,6,8,12,24(default))

**_srb2_**

Select to connect (`true`) this channel's P input to the SRB2 pin. This closes a switch between P input and SRB2 for the given channel, and allows the P input to also remain connected to the ADC. It's a 'Bool' where `true` connects this input to SRB2 (default) or `false` which disconnect this input from SRB2.

**_srb1_**
           
Select to connect (`true`) all channels' N inputs to SRB1. This effects all pins, and disconnects all N inputs from the ADC. It's a 'Bool' where `true` connects all N inputs to SRB1 and `false` disconnects all N inputs from SRB1 (default).

**_Returns_** a promise, if the commands were sent to write buffer.

### .write(dataToWrite)

Send commands to the board. Due to the OpenBCI board firmware, a 10ms spacing **must** be observed between every command sent to the board. This method handles the timing and spacing between characters by adding characters to a global write queue and pulling from it every 10ms.

**_dataToWrite_** 

Either a single character or an Array of characters

**_Returns_** a promise, fulfilled if the board has been connected and `dataToWrite` has been added to the write queue, rejected if there were any problems.

**Example**

Sends a single character command to the board.
```js
// ourBoard has fulfilled the promise on .connected() and 'ready' has been observed previously
ourBoard.write('a');
```

Sends an array of bytes
```js
// ourBoard has fulfilled the promise on .connected() and 'ready' has been observed previously
ourBoard.write(['x','0','1','0','0','0','0','0','0','X']);
```

Taking full advantage of the write queue. The following would be sent at t = 0, 10ms, 20ms, 30ms 
```js
ourBoard.write('t');
ourBoard.write('a');
ourBoard.write('c');
ourBoard.write('o');
```

## Events

### .on('close', callback)

Emitted when the serial connection to the board is closed.

### .on('error', callback)

Emitted when there is an on the serial port.

### .on('impedanceArray', callback)

Emitted when there is a new impedanceArray available.

### .on('query', callback)

Emitted resulting in a call to `.getChannelSettings()` with the channelSettingsObject

### .on('rawDataPacket', callback)

Emitted when there is a new raw data packet available.

### .on('ready', callback)

Emitted when the board is in a ready to start streaming state.

### .on('sample', callback)

Emitted when there is a new sample available.

## Properties 

### connected

A bool, true if connected to an OpenBCI board, false if not.

### streaming

A bool, true if streaming data from an OpenBCI board, false if not.

## Useful Constants

To use the constants file simply:
```js
var openBCIBoard = require('openbci-sdk');
var k = openBCIBoard.OpenBCIConstants;

console.log(k.OBCISimulatorPortName); // prints OpenBCISimulator to the console.
```

### .OBCISimulatorPortName

The name of the simulator port.

## Interfacing With Other Tools

### LabStreamingLayer

[LabStreamingLayer](https://github.com/sccn/labstreaminglayer) by SCCN is a stream management tool designed to time-synchronize multiple data streams, potentially from different sources, over a LAN network with millisecond accuracy (given configuration). 

For example, a VR display device running a Unity simulation may, using the [LSL4Unity](https://github.com/xfleckx/LSL4Unity) library, emit string markers into LSL corresponding to events of interest (For the P300 ERP, this event would be the onset of an attended, unusual noise in a pattern of commonplace ones). The computer doing data collection via the OpenBCI_NodeJS library (potentially with 4ms accuracy) would then output into an LSL stream the EEG and AUX data. LSL can then synchronize the two clocks relative to each other before inputting into a different program or toolkit, like [BCILAB](https://github.com/sccn/BCILAB) for analysis to trigger responses in the Unity display.

This requires OpenBCI_NodeJS exporting data into LSL. Currently, there does not exist a pre-built NodeJS module for LSL, though LSL comes with tools that could possibly allow creation of one. In the meantime, the simpler route is to use a concurrent python script (driven by NodeJS module [python-shell](https://www.npmjs.com/package/python-shell)) to handoff the data to LSL for you, like so:

In your NodeJS code, before initializing/connecting to the OpenBCIBoard:
```js
// Construct LSL Handoff Python Shell
var PythonShell = require('python-shell');
var lsloutlet = new PythonShell('LslHandoff.py');

lsloutlet.on('message', function(message){
    console.log('LslOutlet: ' + message);
});
console.log('Python Shell Created for LSLHandoff');
```

In your NodeJS code, when reading samples:
```js
st = sample.channelData.join(' ')
//getTime returns milliseconds since midnight 1970/01/01
var s = ''+ sample.timeStamp + ': '+ st
lsloutlet.send(s)
```

in LSLHandoff.py:
```py
from pylsl import StreamInfo, StreamOutlet
info = StreamInfo('OpenBCI_EEG', 'EEG', 8, 250, 'float32', '[RANDOM NUMBER HERE]')
outlet = StreamOutlet(info)
while True:
    strSample = raw_input().split(': ',1)
    sample = map(float, strSample[1].split(' '))
    stamp = float(strSample[0])

    outlet.push_sample(sample, stamp)
    print('Pushed Sample At: ' + strSample[0])
```
AUX data would be done the same way in a separate LSL stream.
